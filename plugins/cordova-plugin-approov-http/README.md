Cordova Approov HTTP
====================

This plugin makes it easier to use Approov in Cordova projects that use the Cordova Advanced HTTP networking plugin.
The Cordova Approov HTTP plugin requires
- the Cordova Advanced HTTP plugin with Request Interceptors, an extension of Cordova Advanced HTTP, added to your
  project
- an instance of the Approov SDK to be included in this plugin before it can be used

How to obtain the Cordova Advanced HTTP plugin with Request Interceptors as well as the Approov SDK, and how to add this
plugin into your project, is described in the Quickstart top level README.md.

Add this plugin into your project as described in the Quickstart top level README.md, which is also available at
